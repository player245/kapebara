					<h3>Capybaras</h3>
					<p>Capybaras are the largest rodents in the world. They have a stout, barrel-shaped body with a head that resembles that of a guinea pig. They typically measure around 1.2 meters (4 feet) in length and stand about 2 feet all at the shoulder. Adult capybaras can weigh between 35 to 65 kilograms. They have short, coarse fur that can vary in color from reddish-brown to grayish-brown. Capybaras are herbivores with a primarily vegetarian diet. They feed on a variety of plant materials, including grasses, aquatic plants, fruits, bark, and tender shoots. They have specialized incisors and cheek teeth designed for grazing and chewing plant matter. Capybaras are also known to engage in a behavior called coprophagy, where they consume their own feces as a way to extract additional nutrients from their food. </p>
					<h3>How we take care of them</h3>
					<p>Our caf√© has gone to great lengths to create a spacious enclosure, thoughtfully designed with lush vegetation, a shallow pond, and ample hiding spots. This allows our capybaras to engage in their natural behaviors and enjoy a comfortable and enriching space. The care of our capybaras is of utmost importance to us. Our dedicated staff members are knowledgeable and trained in capybara care, ensuring that their every need is met. We recognize the importance of human interaction for these sociable creatures. Our capybaras are accustomed to gentle contact and enjoy the company of visitors in our designated petting area. Education is a core aspect of our mission. We believe in raising awareness about capybaras and their conservation needs. Through informative sessions, we share knowledge about their natural habitat, behavior, and the efforts being made to protect them in the wild. By fostering understanding and appreciation, and with this we aim to inspire our guests to become advocates for capybaras and other wildlife.</p>
