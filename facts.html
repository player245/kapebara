					<h3>How we Began</h3>
					<p>Our journey began with three close friends from high school who were passionate about assisting in Capybara rescue organizations and who also had a dream of starting a modest café. In order to begin our dream business,We diligently saved up money from part-time employment beginning in the year 2019.  Our idea was to open a cozy café with a capybara, a place where people could gather, enjoy a moment with the capybaras, and savor delicious coffee and warm pastries. After months of meticulous planning, and searching for the perfect location, Our dream finally became a reality, by the year 2022 we finally got to open our dream cafe along the streets of olive, in Las pinas City, and is now doing a pretty well done job for a small business.  </p>
					<h3>What We Do</h3>
					<p>We offer a warm and inviting atmosphere, where everyone can unwind and indulge in our delightful beverages and mouthwatering pastries, all while enjoying a personal interaction with our friendly and rescued capybaras. Complimentary Wi-Fi is also available to our customers, allowing them to share and document their unique experience. Our goal is to provide visitors with an immersive and educational encounter, allowing them to observe and learn about capybaras and their habitats, as well as contribute to conservation efforts. We aim to create spaces where patrons can find comfort in the presence of animals and experience the therapeutic advantages they offer. Ultimately, our aim is to deliver a distinctive and unforgettable experience for our valued visitors. </p>
